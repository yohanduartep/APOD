# APOD
Download Astronomical Picture of the Day! This script is just a way to run <h>https://github.com/yohanduartep/APOD-Script</h> without you have to configure your API from NASA.

1. Download apod.sh

2. Run it to download the images from NASA APOD to your $HOME/Pictures (Images updated everyday)

3. Use some manager (I use hyprpaper) to load the image as your wallpaper.

## Recommendations

Use your autostart or exec-once to run the script when booting your pc then just use your wallpaper manager to load the wallpaper images from you pictures folder.
